# EV Charger Route Planner

In a similar fashion to my previous [repo/project](https://github.com/robert-waggott/animals-stuck-up-trees-and-other-incidents) this primarily acts as a test bed/proof of concept to both test new concepts and keep technicalskills up-to-date where they may not be being used every day.

The idea of this project is to build a route planning engine that will also allow the user to work out where and when to stop to charge their Electric/plug in hybrid vehicle. Whereas the previous repo/project had little practical use my thinking with this is that it will have some use, even just for myself.
